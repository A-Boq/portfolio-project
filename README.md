# Angelica Boquiron - Front End Developer

This is a personal portfolio website. It will be a platform to house my projects which will showcase the range of Front End Developer and creative skills I have. It will be used by industry professionals including recruiters, employers and collaborators.

## User Stories
- As a Recruiter/Employer I want to see a clear and concise layout for the portfolio, to be able to navigate it with ease, and to view the projects, experiences, and languages used.
- As a collaborator I want to see the projects, current knowledge and experience in terms of languages used, and where I can add value for future projects.
